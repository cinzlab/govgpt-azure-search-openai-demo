This includes using software that captures authentication, time, and source details, maintaining these details in their original form, and being able to provide them upon request. \n\nOn the other hand, managing signature authority involves safeguarding how and when your electronic signature and credentials are used, and controlling who has the authority to use your electronic signature on your behalf. Both aspects emphasize the importance of security and control, but while the software requirements focus on the technical integrity of the signature process, managing signature authority is about controlling access and delegation of signing rights.",
