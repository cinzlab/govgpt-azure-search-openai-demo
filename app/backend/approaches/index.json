    "title": "Lizard  Annotation Nevan shows that he has early reading behaviours under control. For example, he: • starts reading from the left and moves in the correct direction, attending to print in an organised way • is aware of the relationship of pictures to the words on a page • demonstrates a sense of story • points to each word as he reads and matches one to one • knows that speech and print are linked. Text The text is a simple compound sentence in a picture caption dictated by Nevan and scribed by the teacher:  “I saw a lizard and he was creeping by the ocean.” Task As an activity in the class literacy time, Nevan paints a picture. He dictates a story for the teacher to write beneath his picture. The teacher reads his story twice to Nevan and then asks him to read it with her. Then they read it again together. The teacher asks Nevan to read aloud the story written under his lizard picture independently, using his finger to point to each word. Student response Nevan reads aloud, “I saw a lizard and he was creeping beside the ocean”, pointing to each word as he reads.",

    "title": "Murphy  Annotation Murphy most often gives accurate responses when providing sounds to the consonants at the start of the scope and sequence. He can run phonemes together, with accuracy, when engaging in phoneme awareness tasks and is just beginning to apply this to the reading of text.  During the reading of the single page of text, Murphy: • provides the accurate letter sound for consonants and taught short vowels • sounds out the first word and runs the sounds together, with guidance from the teacher • seeks help for the high-frequency words • points to words as he tries decoding them.  Text Tap, Tap This book is from the start of the Kākano phase in the Ready to Read Phonics Plus series. The story is about Nat, who is playing with her toy drum at home, but decides that tapping other things in the house with her drumsticks is a bit more interesting.  The book contains the focus letter-sound patterns of T, A, P, M, and E and contains a large number of decodable words that have those letters. All vowels are pronounced as short vowels. There are a small number of high-frequency words. Sentences are short and in the present tense.",

Kate is confidently making use of her letter-sound knowledge and phonological strategy of blending to read unfamiliar words in text.  As Kate reads the text, she: • independently sounds out and blends words with single consonants and short vowels, while taking longer to sound out and blend words with newly introduced spelling patterns • reads the rest of the sentence even if the resulting blending attempt did not lead to a real word. Text Weka in the Shed This book is from the end of the Kākano phase of the Ready to Read Phonics Plus series. The short story follows Weka’s adventure into a farm shed to find something interesting.   The book contains the focus consonant digraphs of sh and ck. It contains a large number of decodable words that have the sh at the start or end of the word, and words with ck at the end. This book is the first book in the series in which words with a consonant digraph have been introduced. There are a small number of high-frequency words. All sentences are short and in the present tense, with some short dialogue sections.",

Jay is not yet reading some words in a phrased way but notices punctuation and its purpose.   During the reading of the text, Jay: • provides the correct sounds to early vowel teams of ee and oo • sounds out and runs together all sounds in words for decoding, including both sounds of consonant blends • quickly recalls and uses some high-frequency words (including I) but is still learning others more recently introduced (including you) • recognises direct speech and attributes the speaker accurately • uses illustrations to confirm the meaning.   Text Frog in a Log This book is from the Tupu phase in the Ready to Read Phonics Plus series. In this story, Huhu has found that Frog would like to make Huhu’s log his own home. Ruru steps in to try and find a way to help both Huhu and Frog.  The book has a focus on extending blending skills into initial blends. Previous books have provided opportunity for learning and applying blending skills to consonant blends that begin with s and blends that contain l as the second letter. Many words in this book contain consonant blends. There are also a number of high-frequency words, most of which children will have read before. There is a range of punctuation, and dialogue appears on each page. The text also provides opportunities to recall and use high-frequency words (including the, is, and says).",

She is confident in reading words that contain consonant blends at both the beginnings and ends of words. Maha reads most words in a phrased way, slowing down to attempt the decoding of words containing newly taught patterns. She automatically recognises high-frequency words.  During the reading of the text, Maha: • usually provides the correct sounds to orthographic patterns including the split digraph (final-e) • sounds out and runs together all sounds in most words for decoding, including both sounds of consonant blends • quickly recalls and reads high-frequency words • checks that what she reads makes sense and uses the context and illustrations to confirm the meaning • uses punctuation to apply the appropriate intonation.   Text Ride to the Top This book is from the Tupu phase in the Ready to Read Phonics Plus series. In this story, Tāne, Nat and Sam are biking to the local roto (lake). They have to ride through a bush track to get there, which includes a hill. Sam gets tired, but the other children encourage him to keep going.   The book has a focus on using the split digraph for the long I sound, for example, bike. There are many opportunities to practise reading this spelling pattern. Previous books have provided an opportunity for learning the split digraph for the long A and long O sound, and there are additional review opportunities in this book. There are also a number of high-frequency words, most of which children will have read before (including “the”, “to”, and “a”). There is a range of punctuation, including exclamation marks, and dialogue appears on each page.",

He checks the meaning of what is read to confirm the correct pronunciation of vowels in words. Kobi automatically recognises and reads high-frequency words and uses appropriate intonation for the sentence structure and punctuation. He can discuss what was read and applies it to other things in the world.  During the reading of the text, Kobi: • reads many words in a phrased way and is beginning to use intonation • pauses occasionally to decode words with new vowel patterns • reads some phrases with intonation • quickly recalls and reads high-frequency words, recognising and self-correcting misread words •  relates what he reads to other contexts.   Text Stay This book is from the Māhuri phase of the Ready to Read Phonics Plus series. In this book, Kea is cleaning the nest and has told her kea chicks to stay. However, the chicks are much more interested in playing around the high country farm’s barn. They have a lot of fun until they run into Ram.  The book has a focus on the ay spelling of the long A sound. There are a number of repeated words that contain the spelling pattern to provide a number of opportunities for practising reading words with this pattern. The book contains a number of vowel patterns for continued practice and reinforcement of those vowel patterns. There are a variety of sentence constructions with some repeated patterns to manage the number of challenges the reader has.",

During the reading of the text, Mason: • fluently reads text, pausing to decode words and check the decoding with the context • quickly recalls and reads high-frequency words • can relate what he reads to prior knowledge.  Text The New Lambs This text follows a clear narrative pattern. When out on the farm, Jake, Emily, and Mum find two lambs who have been abandoned. They take the lambs into their home to feed and care for them.  There are six to eight sentences (four to seven lines) per page. The sentences are primarily simple sentences, with a smaller number of complex sentences. Dialogue is clearly attributed to the speaker. There is a range of punctuation, including speech marks, commas, question marks, and exclamation marks to support phrasing, intonation, and meaning.  The text contains many high-frequency words and high-interest words that are likely to be in a reader’s oral vocabulary. The words are strongly supported by the context and sentence structure, for example, “lambs”, “alive”, “bottles”, and “sadly”. There is also a wide range of verbs and verb forms including “helping”, “cried”, “think”, and “die”. There is a wide range of orthographic patterns through the book for students to apply their decoding knowledge to, including “check”, “laughed”, and “wrapped”.",

For example, he:  • problem-solves unfamiliar words successfully  • automatically recognises all the high-frequency words  • mostly reads fluently and with expression • uses punctuation to support meaning.  Bengie is aware of the errors he is making and is able to self-correct these errors using self- monitoring strategies, such as using context cues to cross-check his decoding attempts and rereading to see if it makes sense.  He develops confidence with each attempt, and his reading becomes more fluent and expressive. However, Bengie still has not fully developed a smoothly functioning reading processing system in a way that will allow him to process and understand text automatically and quickly.  Text  Someone I Could Look Up To In this autobiographical article, Apirana (Api) Taylor briefly outlines his work and describes two of his role models: Sir Apirana Ngata, who he is named after, and Vera Morgan, who is not only a close family friend but also a hard worker for the Māori community.  This text has been deliberately created to support readers who are still developing a reading processing system. It is written in a mix of present and past tenses as Api switches between describing his current life and work and describing events in the past. It contains mostly simple and compound sentences, with some straightforward complex sentences. The text includes some topic- specific words, for example, “performer”, “overseas”, “tour”, “journalist”, “musician”, “president”, and “celebrations”, that are supported by the context. A glossary explains the more unfamiliar vocabulary. The text also includes a fact box, with bullet points outlining Sir Apirana’s key achievements and talents. Photos accompany the text but do not support the vocabulary challenges.",

    "title": "1   FAQ about the Learning Progression Frameworks Why are there no NZC levels on the LPFs? The LPFs are not displayed with curriculum levels. The main reason for this is to avoid defining curriculum expectations for the individual aspects of the LPFs using curriculum boundaries that were designed to represent overall, on-balance curriculum expectations. The curriculum boundaries for the PaCT scale were based on an exercise that considered achievement against all aspects. In other words, each curriculum boundary represents an averaging of expectations across the aspects. This means that sometimes a set of illustrations for a given aspect could be lower or higher than might be expected if the position of the boundary line was mapped to that aspect alone. Why are NZC levels displayed in PaCT?  When used in PaCT, the LPFs provide the structure for making summative judgments about achievement against the curriculum. For each aspect, in the appropriate framework, teachers decide which set of illustrations best fits what they know a student can do by themselves and most of the time.  PaCT then synthesises these best-fit decisions into an overall score (judgment) on the PaCT scale. Because the PaCT scale has been linked to curriculum expectations, teachers can use PaCT to see how students have achieved overall in terms of curriculum levels. Some of the graphical reports available on PaCT show how the sets of illustrations ‘line up’ against the PaCT scale. Each set is shown at the point on the scale where the overall score predicts that the set has become more likely to be selected as the best-fit set for a student than the preceding set of illustrations for the aspect. In PaCT, showing the sets in relation to the scale provides information about the typical level of overall achievement associated with each set.",

    "title": "1   The big ideas of the reading framework   Making sense of text: using a processing system When learning to read, students use their developing understanding of the written code to decode the text. As their reading becomes fluent, students draw on their increasing understanding of how words work, to read with automaticity. They develop confidence in using many sources of information to make sense of text, monitor their understanding, and take action if this breaks down. As they progress through school, students develop expertise in reading an increasing range of texts with greater independence, fluency, awareness, and control over their repertoire of strategies. Set 1 Students understand that books have print, and print tells the story. Students are beginning to recognise consonant and vowel letters and provide the most common phonic sounds for them to read simple words in text. Students use their developing phonemic awareness to apply phonological strategies to word reading. Students can attend to print in an organised way including one-to-one matching and directional movement.  Set 2 Students attempt to use phonics knowledge to decode and understand text. Students provide the sounds to a variety of increasingly complex orthographic (grapheme-phoneme) patterns to decode words in text.  Students are able to quickly recognise and read an increasing number of high-frequency print words.  The students’ self-monitoring is indicated by the fact that they are beginning to notice and correct mismatches (errors). They use illustrations to support their decoding attempts. They read some words together in a phrased way and are beginning to use intonation.  Students are beginning to make meaning beyond their prior knowledge and can retell stories they have read themselves. Set 3 Students are using their growing knowledge of the print system to read with fluency and understanding. Students look carefully at each word and sound out new and complex orthographic patterns, or fluently read words with known orthographic patterns and use context-based cues to cross-check their decoding attempts. They automatically recognise most high-frequency words in their instructional texts.  As fluency increases, students begin to make greater connections between their prior knowledge and what they read. Students can retell what they read as well as discuss what they read.",

It is important that these are used alongside the sets of illustrations, which support a deeper understanding of what developing expertise looks like by highlighting how students use their knowledge and skills to respond to a specific task. If the big ideas are used without the illustrations there is a reasonable possibility that teachers will interpret them in a variety of different ways.    The big ideas of the writing framework        Writing meaningful text: encoding Beginning writers put a lot of their focus on encoding (or spelling) the words they want to use. As they develop their expertise in using the code fluently, they are able to use more of their cognitive resources to convey meaning. This expertise includes applying their knowledge of how words work as well as being able to draw on an expanding memory bank of high-frequency words. Set 1  The students are aware that ideas and experiences can be recorded. They usually create texts by using random letters and symbols to convey a message. Their recognisable words are usually personal words, such as their name. The spacing and directionality in their text is inconsistent. Set 2 The students attempt to record their ideas and experiences by using a combination of letters and words. Their texts usually include a few known words, such as “I” and “the”, as well as personal words, such as family names. They are starting to hear, say, and record mostly initial and final sounds and some dominant medial sounds in the words they want to use. They attempt to form letters correctly using a mixture of upper and lower case.  Set 3 The students encode words by matching sounds to letters across each word with beginning, medial, and end sounds evident in most of their words. They attempt to use their knowledge of common word endings and simple rimes to generate words, and they recognise that there may be more than one way to represent a sound. The students are building a bank of high-frequency words (Essential Word Lists 1 and 2) as well as personal words that can be written accurately and fluently.   Their letters are mostly recognisable, although they are not yet always uniform or accurate, and upper and lower cases are inconsistent. Set 4  The students spell words by using both phonetic and visual information as well as by drawing on their bank of high-frequency words (Essential Lists 1–4) and personal words. Their approximations show that they are mapping sounds to letters across each word. They successfully use some sound-letter combinations, analogies, suffixes, spelling rules, and simple spelling patterns. They use vowels in each syllable, although not necessarily correctly. The students self-correct phonetically regular words and some irregular basic words, using visual knowledge and information, during both crafting and re-crafting.",

    "title": "1   A rationale for the seven aspects in the reading framework How the aspects were selected The reading framework describes students’ developing  expertise as they respond to the increasingly challenging reading demands that are integral to most rich learning tasks throughout the curriculum. Although the framework incorporates knowledge and skills, its main focus is on supporting teachers to consider how students are using these purposefully to complete literacy-dependent curriculum tasks.  The Ministry of Education convened workshops with literacy experts (academics, researchers, and teachers) to discuss the ways in which both reading and writing should be organised for the PaCT frameworks. The experts advised that the reading framework should address the different aspects of students’ reading for a range of different purposes across the New Zealand Curriculum. They recommended that the aspects focus on the reading behaviours that teachers need to notice as well as on the students’ ability to draw on these and to use their reading for specific learning purposes.  Initially influenced by the PISA framework, the experts thought that reading continuous text should be addressed separately from reading non-continuous text, but then revised their advice after considering the extent to which continuous and non-continuous text appeared together. They also advised that digital or online texts should be included in the framework, and again, initially this was to be as a separate aspect from those that focused on reading texts in print. This decision was revised during the development of the aspect dealing with knowledge of text structure. The other key point the experts made was that the reading and writing frameworks needed to be developed together, reflecting the reciprocity between these, to the extent that the possibility of developing aspects shared by both frameworks should be also explored.  As well as developing aspects that addressed how students were using their processing (or decoding) skills and their vocabulary knowledge to make meaning from texts, the development team decided early in the project to include specific aspects that looked at how students use their knowledge of text structure to engage with texts and at how well they applied critical thinking skills. The latter could well have remained a thread within the other aspects, but feedback from professional learning facilitators working in schools suggested that it might need the extra attention that could be gained from being a separate aspect. Both aspects are highly significant when considering how well students engage with digital or online texts: the first in terms of the way in which they use the structure of the text to navigate and understand it, and the second in terms of their awareness of being positioned by an author (for example, how well they apply critical thinking skills to detect bias). By creating these two aspects, it was possible to incorporate digital texts across all aspects. Not only was this decision in line with current practice (most teachers plan curriculum tasks using both digital and print texts), it also acknowledged that digital texts are likely to soon become the dominant medium for acquiring information and ideas. Also, most importantly, the development team wanted to avoid suggesting that engaging with digital texts involves significantly different knowledge and skills from reading texts in print.  From the outset, the PaCT development team recognised that a key risk for the reading framework was that many teachers would make decisions about their students’ reading on the basis of the text level alone, rather than noticing the way in which the students use that text as part of a curriculum learning activity. Accordingly, a major challenge was to find a way to focus teachers on the students’ reading behaviours and how well they were able to draw on these to meet the literacy-related",

They advised that students needed to be able to write meaningful texts both in print and using digital devices, and that these texts included a range of text types comprising different features and structures, with a focus on students’ ability to write for a number of different curriculum-related purposes. They also supported the approach that was taken in the Literacy Learning Progressions, which was to consider writing as a tool for thinking as well as a means for students to record and communicate their knowledge and understanding, experiences, and ideas. From the outset, the PaCT development team recognised that a key risk for the writing framework was that many teachers would make decisions about their students’ writing that were mostly based on the structure and vocabulary of the texts they produce, instead of also noticing the way in which the students create those texts as part of a curriculum learning activity. Accordingly, a major challenge was to find a way to focus teachers on how well students use their writing to meet the literacy-related demands of their task, in terms of the relevance and appropriateness of the texts they create. The decision was made to use the same writing tasks in different aspects to encourage teachers to focus on a particular aspect of a student’s response: for example, their encoding skills, their ability to select and use an appropriate text structure, or the precision of the words and phrases they use. The team also decided that where student responses comprised a text the student had written by hand, these would sometimes be typed up so that the quality of the student’s handwriting did not distract from the particular aspect under consideration. Students in years 9 and 10 need to further develop literacy-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are specific to subject areas. These sets of knowledge and skills are shaped by the kinds of texts and tasks that the curriculum requires them to engage with in order to research, think, and communicate in ways that are appropriate to a particular subject. Such differentiation is described in the literature as “disciplinary literacy”1.The implications for teaching are significant: the literacy expertise that students need to develop in order to meet, for example, objectives at level 5 in the science curriculum is best taught within the science programme, rather than relying on students being able to apply generalisable skills they’ve learned in English. Accordingly, the writing",
